  <!-- Minimal launch file to bringup the robot hardware -->
  <!-- This launch file will launch the package that communicates with the encoders
       before running the ROS Controls hardware_interface control loop.
       Note: roslaunch launches local processes using popen and kills them using POSIX signals. 
       roslaunch does not guarantee any particular order to the startup of nodes. 
       In the ROS architecture there is no way to tell when a node is initialized.
